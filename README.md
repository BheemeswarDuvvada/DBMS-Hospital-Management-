# DBMS-Hospital-Management-
The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a comprehensive and integrated database 
management system developed to help hospitals manage patient information, medical records, and 
hospital resources. The system is based on a relational database management system (RDBMS), 
which effectively stores and retrieves data, allowing for quick access to accurate and up-to-date 
information. Modules for patient registration, appointment scheduling, medical record 
administration, prescription management, billing and payment, inventory management, and staff 
management are included in the system. The Hospital Management System is intended to improve 
patient care quality, streamline administrative procedures, and increase the efficiency of hospital 
operations. The system can be tailored to match the specific requirements of individual hospitals, 
and it provides a dependable and secure platform for managing essential healthcare data.
